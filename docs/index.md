# Welcome! I'm Jingxuan.

<img title="" src="me.jpeg" alt="" width="439" data-align="center">

Intrigued by the crossroads of finance, data analysis and biotechnology, I bring a unique and open-minded perspective to my work.

My academic foundation was built at THU and is currently being fortified at HKU. For a comprehensive look at my credentials, please view my [CV](CV/CV_Jingxuan_Wang.pdf).

Outside the academic sphere, I channel my passion into community volunteering and long-distance cycling, while maintaining an adventurous palate for spicy cuisine.
